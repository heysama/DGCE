#  Discord Guild Crash Exploit

**Explanation**

This exploit constantly changes each defined guilds name to a random unicode string of 100 characters, causing the Discord client to lag or even crash.

I developed this exploit a while back (back in October/November, 2019), but my stuff recently got seized by the police, so I had to redevelop it, heh.

I've reported this exploit multiple times, but the Discord staff team kept declining them, as they meant you will get rate limited, which you don't, lol, so I've decided to release this to the public.
